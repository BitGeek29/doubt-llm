# Doubt-LLM

Doubt-LLM is an AI-powered tool designed to solve NCERT (National Council of Educational Research and Training) questions efficiently. It leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to provide accurate and detailed solutions to students' doubts in various subjects.

## Features
- **NCERT Question Solving**: Provides solutions to NCERT textbook questions across subjects.
- **AI-Powered Responses**: Uses advanced LLM models to generate detailed and precise answers.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for students to input their questions.
- **Image Support**: Upload image to input their questions.
- **Multi-Subject Support**: Covers subjects like Physics, Chemistry, and Biology.
- **Detailed Explanations**: Offers step-by-step solutions to help students understand concepts better.
- **Interactive Learning**: Engages users by allowing them to refine queries for improved responses.

## How It Works
1. **Input Question**: Users enter their NCERT question into the system.
2. **Processing by LLM**: The AI model analyzes the question and generates a structured answer.
3. **Solution Output**: The generated answer is displayed, providing explanations where needed.
4. **Follow-up Queries**: Users can refine their queries for better understanding.
